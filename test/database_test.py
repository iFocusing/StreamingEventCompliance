#TODO: Jingjing: tell the modified structure to qiqi, then submit and push it.
# 1. Move filefolder "test" to filefolder "objects"; (Because the test is like the exception, we maybe should write class)
# 2. Add thedatabaseTest.py under project path
# 3. In application.py redefine  testdb = DatabaseTest()
